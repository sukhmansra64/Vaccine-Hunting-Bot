The Ontario COVID-19 Vaccination Bot is a discord bot which responds to a user with nearby vaccine locations after the user states their postal code. Furthermore, the user can privately input its address into the bot and the bot will find the directions to the nearest pharmacy offering vaccines. It is programmed using the Node js framework in Javascript, and the Google Maps API in Google Cloud. The data for the clinics was ethically web scraped from the Government of Ontario's official list of pharmacies giving vaccines for COVID-19.

This bot is a submission to the RU Hacks hackathon.
